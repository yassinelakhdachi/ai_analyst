AI is a subfield of computer science that aims at building computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

## The Three Eras of Computing:
The three eras are described in the following sections:

+ Tabulating Era (1890-1940)
+ Programming Era
+ AI and Cognitive Era

## Artificial Intelligence Types and Approaches:

Most smart software programs can be considered as AI systems because they perform tasks that can be considered intelligent human tasks. Researchers and developers are adopting one of two approaches of thinking while building AI systems:

+ **Strong AI**
+ **Weak AI**

The first approach builds systems that can act and think intelligently like people do. This approach simulates human reasoning and cognition in general tasks and is called strong AI. Most of these projects are in the small-to-medium size range. The three largest projects are DeepMind, the Human Brain Project (an academic project that is based in Lausanne, Switzerland), and OpenAI.

The second approach is not concerned about whether the AI systems display human-like cognitive functions; the focus is on AI systems that perform specific tasks accurately and correctly. This approach is called weak AI. An example of weak AI is a chatbot, which is trained to answer a specific set of questions about a domain. A chatbot does not have self-awareness or genuine intelligence.

Generally, current AI is somewhere between strong and weak AI. The current most advanced AI research uses human reasoning as a model but the AI field has not modeled human reasoning yet. A good example of current AI is advanced natural language generation.
