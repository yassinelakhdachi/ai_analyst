AI is a subfield of computer science that aims at building computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

## The Three Eras of Computing:
The three eras are described in the following sections:

+ Tabulating Era (1890-1940)
+ Programming Era
+ AI and Cognitive Era

## Artificial Intelligence Types and Approaches:

Most smart software programs can be considered as AI systems because they perform tasks that can be considered intelligent human tasks. Researchers and developers are adopting one of two approaches of thinking while building AI systems:

+ **Strong AI**
+ **Weak AI**

The first approach builds systems that can act and think intelligently like people do. This approach simulates human reasoning and cognition in general tasks and is called strong AI. Most of these projects are in the small-to-medium size range. The three largest projects are DeepMind, the Human Brain Project (an academic project that is based in Lausanne, Switzerland), and OpenAI.

The second approach is not concerned about whether the AI systems display human-like cognitive functions; the focus is on AI systems that perform specific tasks accurately and correctly. This approach is called weak AI. An example of weak AI is a chatbot, which is trained to answer a specific set of questions about a domain. A chatbot does not have self-awareness or genuine intelligence.

Generally, current AI is somewhere between strong and weak AI. The current most advanced AI research uses human reasoning as a model but the AI field has not modeled human reasoning yet. A good example of current AI is advanced natural language generation.

## Evolution of Artificial Intelligence Types:

In terms of scope, **Ray Kurzweil**, who is a futurist that is working for Google, identifies three levels of AI:

+ **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** : 
    ANI, which belongs to the weak AI school, refers to applying AI techniques to narrow problems. It focuses on a specific task. The strength of ANI is that it focuses on doing something extremely well, sometimes exceeding a human’s capabilities. ANI is a good fit for automating simple and repetitive tasks.
    
    Examples of ANI are bots and virtual assistants, such as **Siri**, **Microsoft Cortana**, Amazon book recommendations that are customized for each user, restaurant recommendations, weather updates, **[Watson DeepQA](https://www.notion.so/DATA-Eng-2b3ffc6d3b854bd787c3287fa3c278c8)**, and customer services chatbots for answering simple and repetitive customer inquiries.
    
+ **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**:
        AGI belongs to the strong AI school. It refers to computer systems that exhibit capabilities of the human brain. AGI refers to systems or machines that can generally perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
        
+ **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)**:
        ASI refers to machines that surpass humans in general intelligence. Nick Bostrom, a leading AI thinker, in the paper [How Long Before Superintelligence?](https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html), defines ASI as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.”. Super-intelligent machines might surpass the human brain in general intelligence.

## Integral Components of Artificial Intelligence Systems:

Because AI is the science of simulating human thinking, it is possible to map the human thinking stages to the layers or components of AI systems: **Sensing**, **interpretation**, and **interacting**.

Consumer-oriented AI systems such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Microsoft Cortana are adopting the three AI components or layers: Sensing, interpretation, and interacting.

Many AI systems focus on prediction. To predict an outcome, AI systems use **data mining** or **machine learning algorithms**. There are different techniques that are used for prediction, such as regression analysis, which is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationship among variables. AI systems build rules that can be used to predict the events of interest before they take place.

According to the type of predicted outcome, AI systems can be categorized into the following two categories:

+ Deterministic systems
+ Probabilistic systems

## Influencers of Artificial Intelligence:

As explained earlier, AI is not a new concept, but the ideas behind it have started to materialize in the last years. This section explores some of the reasons why AI is taking off now.

The following influencers of AI are described in this section:

+ Big data: Structured data versus unstructured data
+ Advancements in computer processing speed and new chip architectures
+ Cloud computing and APIs
+ Emergence of data science

### Transportation:

Autonomous transportation refers to self-driven vehicles, such as **driverless cars** and **unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)**, which are vehicles that can sense their environment and navigate without human input. Autonomous transportation will soon be commonplace, and likely include cars, trucks, flying vehicles, and personal robots.

### Home Services and Robots:

Home services and robots have already entered people’s homes in the form of vacuum cleaners and personal assistants. Better chips, low-cost 3D sensors, cloud-based machine learning, and advances in speech understanding will enhance future robots’ services and their interactions with people. Special purpose robots will clean offices, and enhance security.

### Healthcare:

In healthcare, there has been a huge forward leap in collecting useful data from personal monitoring devices and mobile apps, **electronic health records (EHRs)** in clinical settings, surgical robots that assist with medical procedures, and service robots that support hospital operations. AI applications can generate new insights that speed up matching subjects to clinical studies, identify promising targets for research, reduce drug discovery times, and provide virtual assistance to patients.

### Education:

Even when quality education will always require active engagement by human teachers, AI can enhance education at all levels, especially by providing personalization at scale. Interactive machine tutors are now being matched to students for teaching science, math, language, and other disciplines. Natural Language Processing, machine learning, and crowdsourcing have boosted online learning and enabled teachers in higher education to multiply the size of their classrooms while addressing individual students’ learning needs and styles.

### Public Safety and Security:

AI technologies are already in use in North America for border administration and law enforcement. By 2030, the government will rely heavily upon them, including improved cameras and drones for surveillance, algorithms to detect financial fraud, and predictive policing.
