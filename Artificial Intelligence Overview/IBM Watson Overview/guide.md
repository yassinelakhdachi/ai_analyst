# IBM Watson Overview

## Introduction to IBM Watson:

IBM Watson is a cognitive system that enables a new partnership between people and computers. It is the **artificial intelligence (AI) offering from IBM**. Watson combines five core capabilities. But in summary  Watson can understand all forms of data, interact naturally with people, and learn and reason, at scale. Data, information, and expertise create the foundation for working with Watson.

Watson AI technologies are available as a set of open application programming interfaces (**APIs**) and software-as-a-service (**SaaS**) industry solutions.
### IBM Watson and the Jeopardy! Challenge:
Jeopardy! is a television quiz show from the US that aired for the first time in 1964. The show features three contestants who solve general knowledge clues. A defining moment in Jeopardy! history was the Jeopardy! with IBM Watson match in 2011, where the IBM Watson AI system took on the two most successful Jeopardy! champions (Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) and won the game.
### What are the IBM Watson Offerings?
IBM Watson is available as:
+ A set of AI services on IBM Cloud
+ Industry solutions for a wide variety of industries
+ Tools, documentation, and samples for developers

## IBM Watson AI Technology Applied to Industry, Business, and Science:
### Watson Health:
AI introduces new ways of working to improve approaches to care and well-being. IBM Watson Health systems understand, reason, and learn to translate information into knowledge and help drive more informed decision-making.

Science is saturated with data. By making connections that might not have been previously considered, Watson can generate new insights that speed up matching subjects to clinical studies, identify promising targets for research, and encourage discovery.

IBM and its Business Partners are building solutions for the benefit of individual patients and larger health populations as providers share and apply insights in real time.

**The New York Genome Center (NYGC)** and IBM announced an initiative to accelerate a new era of genomic medicine by using IBM Watson AI technologies. To learn about the NYGC and IBM Watson Group collaboration to advance genomic medicine.

**Imaging precision** improved as a result of technological advancements and breakthroughs in computer vision and related research. Those advancements led to exponential growth in medical imaging data with an increasing number of images per exam, a growing number of exams per population, and declining reimbursement per procedure, all leading to increasing demand for efficiency and quality.

Watson Health Imaging introduces solutions that analyze structured and unstructured patient, population, and medical research data that is in disconnected silos.

## Watson Education Classroom:
BM Watson Education is focused on using AI to improve learning outcomes and implement solutions that help all students succeed. It uses AI technology to give teachers the tools that they need to be at their most effective and help learners perform at the top of their abilities.

By using AI as an assistant in the classroom, the goal is to encourage lifelong learning where each person has the individualized tools that they need to succeed in school and beyond.

+ Watson Education helps teachers personalize the teaching and learning experience
+ thousands of students can now learn at their own pace by using one-on-one digital tutoring tools
