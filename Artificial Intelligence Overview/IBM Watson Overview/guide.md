# IBM Watson Overview

## Introduction to IBM Watson:

IBM Watson is a cognitive system that enables a new partnership between people and computers. It is the **artificial intelligence (AI) offering from IBM**. Watson combines five core capabilities. But in summary  Watson can understand all forms of data, interact naturally with people, and learn and reason, at scale. Data, information, and expertise create the foundation for working with Watson.

Watson AI technologies are available as a set of open application programming interfaces (**APIs**) and software-as-a-service (**SaaS**) industry solutions.
### IBM Watson and the Jeopardy! Challenge:
Jeopardy! is a television quiz show from the US that aired for the first time in 1964. The show features three contestants who solve general knowledge clues. A defining moment in Jeopardy! history was the Jeopardy! with IBM Watson match in 2011, where the IBM Watson AI system took on the two most successful Jeopardy! champions (Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) and won the game.
### What are the IBM Watson Offerings?
IBM Watson is available as:
+ A set of AI services on IBM Cloud
+ Industry solutions for a wide variety of industries
+ Tools, documentation, and samples for developers

## IBM Watson AI Technology Applied to Industry, Business, and Science:
### Watson Health:
AI introduces new ways of working to improve approaches to care and well-being. IBM Watson Health systems understand, reason, and learn to translate information into knowledge and help drive more informed decision-making.

Science is saturated with data. By making connections that might not have been previously considered, Watson can generate new insights that speed up matching subjects to clinical studies, identify promising targets for research, and encourage discovery.

IBM and its Business Partners are building solutions for the benefit of individual patients and larger health populations as providers share and apply insights in real time.

**The New York Genome Center (NYGC)** and IBM announced an initiative to accelerate a new era of genomic medicine by using IBM Watson AI technologies. To learn about the NYGC and IBM Watson Group collaboration to advance genomic medicine.

**Imaging precision** improved as a result of technological advancements and breakthroughs in computer vision and related research. Those advancements led to exponential growth in medical imaging data with an increasing number of images per exam, a growing number of exams per population, and declining reimbursement per procedure, all leading to increasing demand for efficiency and quality.

Watson Health Imaging introduces solutions that analyze structured and unstructured patient, population, and medical research data that is in disconnected silos.

### Watson Education Classroom:
BM Watson Education is focused on using AI to improve learning outcomes and implement solutions that help all students succeed. It uses AI technology to give teachers the tools that they need to be at their most effective and help learners perform at the top of their abilities.

By using AI as an assistant in the classroom, the goal is to encourage lifelong learning where each person has the individualized tools that they need to succeed in school and beyond.

+ Watson Education helps teachers personalize the teaching and learning experience
+ thousands of students can now learn at their own pace by using one-on-one digital tutoring tools

### Watson Internet of Things:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is radically changing the way that businesses operate and people interact with the physical world.

An intelligent IoT that is enriched by AI can make sense of all types of data. It can choose its own data sources and decide the patterns and relationships to which pay attention. It uses machine learning and advanced processing to organize the data and generate insights. A cognitive IoT can also evolve and improve on its own through learned self-correction and adaptation. The IoT provides access to the data from millions of devices.

+ IBM Watson IoT helps companies to connect with everything from personal appliances to manufacturing equipment.
+ Manufacturers are changing their products to add sensors and AI capabilities while interconnecting “things”.
+ IBM IoT for Energy and Utilities offers enterprise-wide data and analytic integration and adds business value by bringing insights that are key to make business decisions.

## Watson for Cybersecurity:

As cyberattacks grow in volume and complexity, AI helps security operations analysts stay ahead of threats.

AI technologies can provide advanced visualizations and interactive vulnerability analysis. AI systems can spot anomalies and flawed logic and provide evidence-based reasoning. Watson for Cybersecurity helps a **security analyst** investigate an incident to uncover new patterns and security contexts.

The process of training Watson for Cybersecurity is by defining the language of security, annotating representative documents, and then manually making correlations between terms. Watson can then learn the language and connections that are needed to respond to questions from security professionals.

## IBM Watson Use Cases:

This section presents two use cases showing organizations that successfully implemented AI solutions that are based on IBM Watson technology to enable new kinds of customer engagement, build better products and services, improve processes and operations, make data-driven decisions, and harness expertise.

+ ## Korean Air:
    
    With Watson, Korean Air is developing an intelligent detection system to improve operational efficiency and on-time performance. Korean Air worked with Watson as follows:
    
    - Watson ingested a variety of structured and unstructured data that is related to maintenance for the hundreds of planes in Korean Air’s fleet.
    - Maintenance defect issues are reported by flight or cabin crews to ground operations.
    - Maintenance employees access data from lookalike cases against technical guidelines.
    - Watson assists to decide probable cause and recommends solutions so that they can be quickly addressed by technicians.
    
    For more information, see “Maintenance done 90% faster” at [https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/airlines-with-watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/airlines-with-watson)
    
+ ## Woodside Energy
    
    The following Watson APIs are used in this solution:
    
    - Natural Language Classifier
    - Watson Assistant
    - Discovery
    
    Watson imported Woodside’s entire 30-year base of 38,000 engineering documents and keeps learning with new experiences. Employees communicate with Watson in natural language. From the answers, employees can derive new insights and make better decisions.
